  - > I learned that program documentation is used to describe the design, functionality, and purpose of a program

  - > It helps developers and users understand howthe program works

  - > Can include: system design documents, user manuals, installation guides, API reference guides, code comments, technical specifications, and release notes

  - > Should be written through the development process, and as modifications are made; through testing, deployment, and maintenance too -- can save time and effort, reduce errors, and improve usability of software

  - > Has many benefits, such as being able to re-use procedures at multiple points in the same program or even in different programs, thus making the code easier to manage and making it easier to update programs

  - > Allows programmers to create modular code that is easier to understand, test, and debug

  - > Breaks down complex tasks into smaller procedures

  - > Programmers can focus ion individual parts of the program at a time

  - > Improves overall quality of code

  - > Reusability & Modularity
