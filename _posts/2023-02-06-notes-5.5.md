<li>General Public Licensing = GPL, can be impacted by Patents<ul>
<li>Using GPL software basically prohibits you from getting rights to charge for software and patents</li>
<li>"open source" --&gt; any work should be free code and can be shared</li>
<li>vs "patent" --&gt; anyone who uses the idea/patent pays royalty</li>
<li>there are even jobs where people analyze the code produced to check if they can charge royalties for the use of their patents</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Black Duck</strong> = a software composition analysis that helps companies and teams manage security, quality, and license compliance risks that come from the use of open source code, and third-party code used in apps and containers</li>
