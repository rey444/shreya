Alumni Panel Tips Notes

  - > Must learn programming going into other engineering fields

Facing Challenges in Class

  - > Googling solutions on the internet helps overcome challenges in class

  - > Keep trying to solve the problem at hand

  - > Focus on your own path, and don’t be discouraged if others do something that’s better than your work or have higher accomplishments
    
      - > There’s always going to be someone better than you\!

  - > Think through problems and flowchart your work + use google to help you solve problems

  - > Don’t be afraid to ask for help from people who know how to do it

  - > Don’t cut corners, have the mindset to go above and beyond

  - > There isn’t only one correct answer/way to do something in CS

  - > Just start coding, and troubleshoot problems as you go

Mechanical Engineering

  - > UCSD: one hands-on project for freshman and senior year each

Project Based Learning in College

  - > Communicate with team members daily

  - > Study in groups and work with others, especially for the first couple years of college (and for general education courses

Coding

  - > Knowing how to code helps you do math in the forms of vectors and matrices

  - > Can code out what your object will look like for 3D printing

  - > Problem solving knowledge besides coding also helps in other classes

  - > Jupyter notebooks are being used for technical papers for interactive work

  - > Stats major: some projects are done in R

  - > Matlab is used in many fields, as well as CS

How to Get a Job or Internship as a College Student

  - > Show up to office hours

  - > Ask teachers questions

  - > Stand out to your teacher and set yourself apart from other students

  - > Many companies look for interns starting in September when the school year starts

  - > Have a resume ready by early September of the year before when you want to work/intern

  - > Create a LinkedIn profile

  - > Build a network of people you know to reach out to get job/internship opportunities
    
      - > Parents, friend’s parents, professors, engineers you know

  - > Getting a referral from someone who works at the company is a good idea

UCSD

  - > Autonomous car projects: go-kart and indy500 autonomous cars
    
      - > Triton AI

  - > Can ask professor if there’s any space in the lab for you to intern

<!-- end list -->

  - > Python scripting, web development, IT tools, how Linux works: all helps in college
    
      - > Colin used these skills at his internship at Northrup Grumman: technical diagrams, website for flight data that takes information from the test database, scripting

Working on Personal Projects

  - > Many companies look for personal projects that you’ve done or made
    
      - > Help set you apart from other applicants to college/jobs/internships

  - > Visual projects are great - ex. Algorithm visualizers

  - > Can even make something fun; doesn’t have to be very life changing

  - > Sorting algorithms, travelling salesman problem, data visualization

  - > Can make scripts to make work on Mechanical Engineering projects easier
    
      - > Data manipulation

  - > Computation Aided Manufacturing
    
      - > Editing G-code + manipulating commands

  - > Material simulations
    
      - > Can help you convert hand functions to actual functions --\> set up a server --\> run the data
