## Create Performance Task Design

6 Steps:

1. Program purpose & function
    - why you are making the program
    - purpose = why you are making it
    - function = what it does
2. Data Abstraction 
    - how do we make it so that data is separated from the code; storing variables, storing data in dictionaries etc.
3. Managing Complexity
    - keeping data out of hard code
4. Procedural Abstraction
    - using functions & making loops to go through procedures rather than listing steps over and over again
5. Algorithm Implementation
    - implementing an algorithm in your code; ex. the score calculator at the end of the quizzes we've been making
6. Testing
    - debugging
    - checking to make sure everything works
