1.1: Collaboration & Why itâ€™s Important for the Industry

Video 1

  - > Example: Facebook
    
      - > Special areas that encourage collaboration

  - > Effective collaboration produces computing innovation that reflects the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who design it

  - > Computing innovation
    
      - > Program as an integral part of its function
    
      - > Can be physical (ex. Self-driving cars), non-physical computing software, or a computing concept like e-commerce

  - > Super Mario Brothers 3
    
      - > Kensuke Tanabe & Shigeru Miyamoto collaborated to use both their ideas for how game levels should be structured to make SMB3
    
      - > Tanabe liked vertical (up-down) levels
    
      - > Miyamoto liked horizontal (left-right) levels
    
      - > Characters could move up, down, left, right, etc.

  - > Collaboration w/ people w/ diverse perspectives helps avoid bias in development of computing innovations

  - > Practice: What are the benefits of collaborating with your peers?
    
      - > B: Effective collaboration produces computing innovation that reflects the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who design it

  - > Takeaways
    
      - > Interpersonal skills learned through collaboration:
        
          - > Communication
        
          - > Consensus building
        
          - > Conflict resolution
        
          - > Negotiation
        
          - > Matter in all fields

  - > Pair programming: when two programmers work together as a pair
    
      - > Driver: writes the program code
    
      - > observer/Pointer/navigator: reviews each line of program code as it is typed in, helps the driver when they need it, provides their perspective

  - > Think-pair-share: think through a problem alone --\> pair with a partner to share ideas --\> share results with the class
    
      - > Ex. like charades
    
      - > The thoughts and ideas of others help you come up with new things

  - > Leave comments in code
    
      - > Helps communicate with partner
    
      - > Helps you communicate/remember your ideas for yourself
    
      - > Acknowledge code segments used from other sources; reference where U got them from
    
      - > Acknowledge media used from other sources: reference where u got them from in a comment
    
      - > Differentiate what you did and what your partner(s) did
    
      - > Clarify the functionality of your code

  - > Tools to help collaborate in class
    
      - > Repl.it
    
      - > GitHub - collaboration & repository
        
          - > Repository = a place where you can put all your projects and get comments/feedback on them
    
      - > Shared document or folder
    
      - > Ask friends to test drive program & give feedback

  - > Takeaways
    
      - > Consultation & communication with users are important aspects of the development of computing innovations
    
      - > Information gathered from potential users can be used to understand the purpose of a program from diverse perspectives & to develop a program that fully incorporates these perspectives
    
      - > Online tools support collaboration by allowing programmers to share & provide feedback to each other
