- **uniform modeling language** = what kind of data we would need in order to create the program; splitting up the data to model what's in the program
- you can track and outline multiple attributes through uniform modeling language outlines
- think about data behavior, data interaction, or data description
- Modeling and UML help with visualization
- **wire frames** = screens that show how your program would look/work; outline what the project will look like
