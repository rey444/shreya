<td><li>includes a list, but the list isn't used to manage complexity in the program</li> <li>I gave the point because the student explains how the program can be written differently without lists, but collegeboard didn't give them the point because their program can be written without the list using an if statement to set cpuPlay variable based on a random number, and because it reslits in a program that's just as easy to develop or maintain as the one with the list</li></td>

<li>In our video, we could demonstrate a user logging in and then answering the questionnaire that helps our program narrow down the best fit chevrolet car for the user</li>
<li>Purpose: to help users find the chevrolet vehicle that would best fit with their transportational needs</li>
<li>Functionality: collecting information for certain attributes and then narrowing down the car model that matches the most of those attributes</li>
<li>input: user answering questionnaire on frontend</li>
<li>output: site telling user which chevrolet vehicle is best fit for them to buy</li>
