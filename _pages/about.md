I enjoy baking, writing, reading, and studying engine maintenance manuals. I'm the co-president of the DNHS Speech & Debate Team, and the co-president of DNHS' South Asian Student Union (SASU). You can regularly find me hiking or training at Karate. In the future, I aspire to become a Mechanical Engineer and pursue my passion for cars. **[click to learn more about SASU!](https://linktr.ee/southasiansu)** [^1].
