    "    - A Berkeley Software Distribution licensed open source library\n",
    "    - used in data science\n",
    "    - used for data analysis, manipulation, and cleaning\n",
    "    - makes programming easier by allowing for simple data modeling and data analysis operations without switching to other languages\n",
    "    - can slice data frames\n",
    "    - can join and merge data frames\n",
    "    - can concatenate columns from 2 data frames\n",
    "    - can change index values in a data frame\n",
    "    - can change column headers\n",
    "    - can convert data into many forms\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scikit Learn\n",
    "    - open source library for machine learning algorithms\n",
    "    - can be used with both supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms\n",
    "    - does cross validation: checking the accurary of supervised models on unseen data\n",
    "        - most common use is for music suggestions on spotify\n",
    "    - has Unsupervised learning algorithms: ex. clustering, factor analysis, principal component analysis, and unsupervised neural networks\n",
    "    - can extract features from photos and text\n",
    "    - helps programmers code because it includes many algorithms and can be used to perform machine learning and data mining tasks\n",
    "        - applications in dimensionality reduction, classification, regression, clustering, and model selection"
