    "- A simulation is a tested scenario used for viewing results/outputs to prepare for them in real world situations \n",
    "\n",
    "- These can be used for games like dice rolling, spinners, etc \n",
    "\n",
    "- These can be used for practical things such as building structures, testing car crashes, and other things before engaging in them in the real world \n",
    "\n",
    "- These simulations can have the option of obeying real world physics (Gravity, collision) or they can go against these norms since this is a fictitious scenario, and couldn't happen in real life"
