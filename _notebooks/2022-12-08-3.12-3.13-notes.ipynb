    "- A **procedure** is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values.\n",
    "- Procedures are referred to by different names, such as **method** or **function**, depending on the programing language.\n",
    "- Parameters are input values of a procedure. **Arguments** specify the values of the parameters when procedure is called.\n",
    "- A procedure call interrupts the **sequential** execution of statements causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. One the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow or control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was called.\n",

    "## Calling Procedures Part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "- When calling procedures, it's important to take notice to whether it returns data, or a block of **statements.**\n",
    "- If the procedure just returns a block of statements, you call the procedure by referring to the procedure name, and **inputting** the arguments.\n",
    "- If the procedure returns some sort of data like a **boolean** or **value**, then you will assign that value to a variable\n",
