    "Your homework for Algorithmic Efficiency is pretty simple.\n",
    "1. Use the 1st code below and graph it (Desmos, TI Inpire Cas, e.t.c), change the x value only! (Plot 5 Points Minimum)\n",
    "2. Label the number of loops done as x and the time (microseconds) to find the index as y\n",
    "3. Connect the points \n",
    "4. Do the same thing with the 2nd code\n",
    "5. Compare the two graphs and explain which one of the two is more efficient and why (min. 2 sentences)\n",
    "6. Insert images of the graph either in your blog or on review ticket"
