<p>I enjoy baking, writing, reading, and studying engine maintenance manuals. I’m the co-president of the DNHS Speech &amp; Debate Team, and the co-president of DNHS’ South Asian Student Union (SASU). You can regularly find me hiking or training at Karate. In the future, I aspire to become a Mechanical Engineer and pursue my passion for cars. <strong><a href="https://linktr.ee/southasiansu">click to learn more about SASU!</a></strong> <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
